# Linear-Regression-Exercise
I learned about linear regression and how it works in python. I also learned about the r value adn how it is maxed out a 1 and the closer the r value is to 1 the better fit the line is. My data set what the review of Las Vegas. I made a groah showing the overall score of the trip to Vegas vs the number of reveiw. My linear regression model showed that as the numebr of reveiws increased the score the of the trip went down.
